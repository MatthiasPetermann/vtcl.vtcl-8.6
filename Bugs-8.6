Bug #1:
-------	This is an ugly one ...
	If a file is closed vTcl does obviously not clean up properly.
	The next 'open' after a 'close' will crash with weird error 
	messages and vTcl reports a mangled file.
	By quiting vTcl and open the file in a newly started session
	everything is fine again.

Bug #2:
-------	After load of itk the vTcl main menu icons are messed up.
