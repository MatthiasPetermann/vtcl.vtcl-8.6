This is a brushup of the last Vtcl-release 1.6.1a1

=====================================================
From now on I lifted the vTcl version to vTcl-8.6
to keep it in sync with the underlying TCL/TK release.
=====================================================

Some fixes of Rildo Pragana to make Vtcl work with
TCL/TK-8.5 are worked in - along with the enhancements
'copyAttr' and 'taborder' that Rildo Pragana supplied
with these fixes in march 2010.
See README-Pragana for some doc on the 'copyattr' and
'taborder' features.


With TCL/TK-8.6 vTcl groked again and I fixed this.

Starting with these fixes I found that a couple of
other things did not work anymore.

---------
mclistbox
... was mourning '...have no option "-state" ..."
Fixed that, but later replaced it the latest mclistbox
code from GitHub, that had fixed this as well and introduced
a few other features like drag & drop.
==> Take this as working

---------
tablelist
... did not work at all with vTcl under TCL/TK-8.6.
I found that it was working with ActiveTcl-8.6 or
when the tablelist libraries were droped in to
the stock TCL/TK libraries - but both I found insufficient
due to the dependecies.
Thus I dropped in the recent release tablelist-5.15 by
Csaba Nehmeti (http://www.csaba-nehmeti.de) below the
Vtcl 'lib' tree so that tablelists gets loaded from here.
==> Take this as 'beta' until it prooves as working properly


--------
iwidgets
... do not work, since itcl was integrated into TCL-8.6
with TCLoo as its foundation. I did not find out why
this cannot work. But I am working on that.


--------------
newer BWidgets (e.g. 1.9.x) fail badly, this needs indepth
investigations
So for now I stick with the original BWidgets 1.3.1 
integrated with vTcl ... oldie but goldie

[- The nasty error message with recent BWidgets 1.9.9: -]
