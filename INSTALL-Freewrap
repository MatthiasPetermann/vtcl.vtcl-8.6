In order to have the Freewrap facility working, you need to install
Freewrap on your system.

What does Freewrap do at all?
Freewrap takes your TCL/TK program and makes a bundle of your
- TCL/TK application file(s)
- system facilities
- optional files (e.g. TCL/TK libraries, Icons, etc.)
and turns all of it into a binary executable file (*.exe on Windows)

Commandline example:
--------------------

freewrap myTCLapp.tcl -o myapp Icons/*



--------------------------
Installation on Unix/Linux
--------------------------
Find a directory where to hook it; in this example I chose
/usr/local and call it <hook>.

Be careful, since Freewrap has no sub directory in the archive.
So we have to make one; e.g. 'Freewrap'

	# cd <hook>; mkdir Freewrap
	# cd Freewrap

That gets us a warm place to unpack the archive:

	# zcat freewrap.<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Now the provisions are made.	

To make the freewrap command available we need to place a sym link
somewhere along the program search path ($PATH). Since I chose
/usr/local/... for the example I stick with this and drop the sym link
into /usr/local/bin.

	# cd /usr/local/bin
	# ln -s /usr/local/Freewrap/linux64/freewrap freewrap
		... or for a 32bit system ...
	# ln -s /usr/local/Freewrap/linux32/freewrap freewrap

That's it ... freewrap is ready to be used.

The words of wisdom ...
You maybe have noticed, that I used an _absolute_path_ to the freewrap
executable. It is VERY IMPORTANT here that a ABSOLUTE PATH will be used.
Freewrap has a mechanism to determine it's own start path after it started.
Freewrap then takes its own code to wrap the bundle and therefore it has to
know where it is positioned in the filesystem.

	THIS WILL FAIL!!!
	-----------------

	|	# cd /usr/local/bin
	|	# ln -s ../Freewrap/linux64/freewrap freewrap
	|
	DON'T USE RELATIVE SYM LINKS TO THE Freewrap EXECUTABLE
