March 10, 2010 -- More Visual Tcl patches
------------------------------------------
If you liked the previous patches I've made to Visual Tcl,
you certainly will like this new release. Now it includes 
a command to copy both regular attributes and geometry
options to other widgets. You should first select a widget,
right-click and choose "Copy/Paste attributes" form the
popup menu. Then you choose which attributes to copy from
the two listboxes (use Control-click or Shift-click to
multiple select), and click "ok".

From now on, each clicked widget will have the attributes 
pasted, until you right-click again and choose the
"Stop Paste attributes" menu item.

Be careful not to place several widgets (with place manager)
one above the other! Also, the geometry management paste only
holds if the destination widget have the same geometry manager
as the source widget. Unfortunatelly, there is not yet any way
to undo the operations, so use carefully! 


February 8, 2010 -- Visual Tcl patched
------------------------------------------
Visual Tcl is a nice GUI builder, but lacks a couple of useful
features, for instance, a way to change the order of widgets.
Well, no more, here is a patched package, with some other fixes
as well. To reorder widgets inside a container (toplevel, frame,
labelframe, etc), select any of the children widgets or its
parent container, right-click and select "Tab order".
The you may choose a widget with the arrow keys, or change
its order up/down with the PgUp/PgDown (Prior/Next) keys.
If a container is inside another, its order may be important
too. Don't overlook it!
