2016-02-04/hph	Fixed the whoppers that made Vtcl crahing with TCL/TK 8.6
		in lib/file.tcl (line numbers after fix)

			124  foreach context [vTcl:namespace_tree] {
			125              if {$context == "::tcl::dict"} continue
			126              if {$context == "::itcl::builtin"} continue     #hph,2016-02-04

			148  foreach context [vTcl:namespace_tree] {
			149              if {$context == "::tcl::dict"} continue
			150              if {$context == "::itcl::builtin"} continue     #hph,2016-02-04

2016-02-12/hph	Fixed a quirk that arose from underlying TK-8.6 that requested a '-state' from
		Mclistbox. I dropped in one into the Mclistbox widget option definitions.
		(see 'lib/Widgets/vtcl/mclistbox.wgt')
				
			368     array set widgetOptions [list \
			369             -background          {background          Background} \
			370             -bd                  -borderwidth \
			.
			.	
			408             -xscrollcommand      {xScrollCommand      ScrollCommand} \
			409             -yscrollcommand      {yScrollCommand      ScrollCommand} \
			410             -state               {state               State} \
			411             ]

2016-02-14/hph	Replaced MClistbox completely with the latest version from GitHub provided by Jeffrey Hobbs
		since it had the missing '-state' option defined and introduced some new features as well


----[0004]----
2016-02-19/hph	Integrated recent tablelist widget by Csaba Nehmeti, since this is supported software.
		Sooner or later this will be a fine replacement for Mclistbox.
		MClistbox is kept for compatibility and historcal reasons. It is slick and fast.

2016-02-22/hph	Changed versioning scheme from "R.ss" to "MM.RR.mm.pppp"
		the new versioning scheme provides 3-4 parts - 3 parts is a must to keep vTcl
		happy. 
		So version 8.7 must be written as '8.7.0' and is called a 'base level'.
		Version 8.7.1 is the first maintetenance level to version '8.7'.
		With 4 fields present it is a 'patch level' that is only provided thru GitHub.
		Patchlevels are not meant for production use.
		Baselevel & maintenance releases go to the repository on Sourceforge.

			MM	- [M]aster relase, 2 digits, First digit cannot be '0'
			RR	- [R]elease, 2 digits
			mm	- [m]aintenance release, 2 digits
			pppp	- [p]atchlevel, 4 digits

2016-02-26/hph	Fixes for Freewrap to work.
		- lib/file.tcl tried to lookup Freewrap by directory name
		  'Freewrap', but it was named 'freewrap'; 
		     # cd lib; mv freewrap Freewrap"
		   fixed this.
		- Provided 'INSTALL-Freewrap' with installaion instruction for
		  Unix/Linux. For windows I need a contribution on that topic.
		- Fixed the missleading instructions that come from the error
		  dialog in lib/file.tcl
