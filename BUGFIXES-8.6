2016-02-04/hph	Fixed the whoppers that made Vtcl crahing with TCL/TK 8.6
		in lib/file.tcl (line numbers after fix)

			124  foreach context [vTcl:namespace_tree] {
			125              if {$context == "::tcl::dict"} continue
			126              if {$context == "::itcl::builtin"} continue     #hph,2016-02-04

			148  foreach context [vTcl:namespace_tree] {
			149              if {$context == "::tcl::dict"} continue
			150              if {$context == "::itcl::builtin"} continue     #hph,2016-02-04

2016-02-12/hph	Fixed a quirk that arose from underlying TK-8.6 that requested a '-state' from
		Mclistbox. I dropped in one into the Mclistbox widget option definitions.
		(see 'lib/Widgets/vtcl/mclistbox.wgt')
				
			368     array set widgetOptions [list \
			369             -background          {background          Background} \
			370             -bd                  -borderwidth \
			.
			.	
			408             -xscrollcommand      {xScrollCommand      ScrollCommand} \
			409             -yscrollcommand      {yScrollCommand      ScrollCommand} \
			410             -state               {state               State} \
			411             ]

2016-02-14/hph	Replaced MClistbox completely with the latest version from GitHub provided by Jeffrey Hobbs
		since it had the missing '-state' option defined and introduced some new features as well


--------------
2016-02-19/hph	Integrated recent tablelist widget by Csaba Nehmeti, since this is supported software.
		Sooner or later this will be a fine replacement for Mclistbox.
		MClistbox is kept for compatibility and historcal reasons. It is slick and fast.
